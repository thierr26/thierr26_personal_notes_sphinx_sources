Base16 color schemes (xterm and Vim)
====================================

.. index::
  pair: Base16 color schemes; xterm
  pair: Base16 color schemes; Vim
  single: .Xresources

To use the Base16 color schemes in xterm and Vim (both terminal Vim and
Vim-GTK), follow the instructions in Scott Pierce's
`Base16 Shell blog post <https://ddrscott.github.io/blog/2017/base16-shell>`_.

I also have this line in my :code:`~/.Xresources`:

  XTerm*termName: xterm-256color

Base16_pop is one of my favorite Base16 schemes.
