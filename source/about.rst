About me and this website
=========================

.. index::
  single: about

My name is Thierry Rascle. I'm a `Debian GNU/Linux <https://www.debian.org>`_
user (at home at least). This website is where I gather my quick notes and
cheatsheets. There's nothing here that you wouldn't find using the internet
search engines but it may come handy sometimes at least for me.

I have `another personal website <http://thierr26.free.fr>`_ which is mainly a
`photo gallery <http://thierr26.free.fr/photo.php>`_.

My Email address: `thierr26@free.fr <mailto:thierr26@free.fr>`_
